ðŸ’» I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley, earning dual degrees in Computer Science and Data Science. I am excited to be joining Northwestern University's M.S. in Machine Learning and Data Science (MLDS) program in Fall 2024.

ðŸ‘ª During my internship at Baidu as a Software Engineer, I focused on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) such as Ernie and InternVL2, specifically for optical character recognition (OCR) tasks. As an undergraduate research assistant, I contributed to two impactful projects: the Deep Learning for Wildfire Detection initiative under Professor [Vivek Rao](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/vivek-rao/), and the Human-centered AI for team collaboration project under Professor [Park Sinchaisri](https://parksinchaisri.github.io/).

ðŸŽ¯ My interests lie in understanding the mechanisms behind cutting-edge LLMs and recommendation systems, and exploring their applications in real-world scenarios. Following my graduate studies, I aim to pursue a career as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer, leveraging data-driven strategies to drive business and operational excellence.
